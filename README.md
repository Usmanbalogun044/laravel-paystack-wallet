# Laravel Wallet with Paystack Integration

The Laravel Wallet system is designed to provide a seamless and efficient way to manage user funds within a web application. It acts as a virtual wallet that allows users to store, deposit, and withdraw money securely. This feature-rich wallet solution is ideal for applications that require internal fund management, such as e-commerce platforms, subscription-based services, or fintech solutions.

By integrating with Paystack, a popular and reliable payment gateway, the Laravel Wallet system offers users the flexibility to fund their wallet using various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and USSD codes. The combination of Laravel's robust framework and Paystack's secure payment processing provides a seamless experience for users.
